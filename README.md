# Relocation Feasibility Portal using Cost of Living Data
This repository contains the group work for the final project for Indiana University's DSCI-D532 class. This project creates a portal for assisting users in making financially-informed relocation decisions by using a dataset from Kaggle that details the cost of living of over 4,500 cities globally. Users will input a salary and their ideal budget breakdown for various categories of expenses in order to produce a list of places that best accommodate their preferences.

## Data Source
The data for this project comes from the Kaggle dataset "Cost of Living Index by City 2022" which can be found at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/cost-of-living-index-by-city-2022).
